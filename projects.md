# Forecasting Brain Data
Focused on predicting brain activity before it happens, this project focuses on using machine learning and various neural network technologies to be able to predict EEG brain time-series data. I have presented my research at UNC Charlotte's 2022 Summer Research Symposium. The research is currrently on an 18-month embargo, so please check back by then to see the results of this research. Otherwise, you may contact me about any questions in the project at [mianjoto@gmail.com](mailto:mianjoto@gmail.com).

# Genshin Impact Wish Simulator
After playing over 2 years of the massively successful gacha game Genshin Impact, I decided to investigate my own luck with rolling for a specific character. In Genshin Impact, you "roll" or "pull" on different event banners to try to get limited time characters and weapons. The chances of getting a character of the highest rarity is 0.6% per pull, which is astonishingly low. I have played the game for a very long time, so I have started devlopment on a simulator that follows the exact mathematics the game uses to calculate pulls, with the end goal of being able to predict when I might be able to get a specific character (given unlimited pulls).
